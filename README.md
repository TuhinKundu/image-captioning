# Image Captioning

Repository containing code for course project done for CS515 Advanced Computer Vision at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Model contains encoder-decoder architecture where Resnet-101 is used as the encoder and various decoders using LSTM, Glove embeddings and BERT model are used to perform an empirical analysis.
